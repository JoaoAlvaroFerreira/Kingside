1. d4 Nf6 2. Nc3 d5 3. Bf4 c5 {This is the most concrete and combative response to the Jobava London. Black immediately tries to exploit the awkwardness of the knight on c3. In contrast to the London System, we do not have the possibility of supporting the pawn with c2-c3. However, the presence of the knight on c3 affords us another exciting possibility that has revitalized this variation.} 4. e4 $5 {This scintillating counterstrike, which became popular a few years ago, is incomparably more exciting and more dangerous for Black than the meek 4.e3. Our idea is straightforward: we aim to exploit our lead in development by blasting open the center.} Nxe4 {By far the most popular recapture at the highest levels.} (4... dxe4 5. dxc5 Qa5 (5... Qxd1+ $6 {This is a very popular move online, but it merely helps White gain control of the only open file. It is important to realize that the trade of queens merely adds to Black's problems; White's initiative does not diminish simply because the ladies are off the board!} 6.

The bishop calmly retreats, and Black is left with further weaknesess in the center.} 9. Bd2 a5 {This move is also not to be feared. Do not automatically play 10.a3, which walks into 10...axb4 - and the knight hangs. Instead, we directly exploit the main drawback of this move, which is that it creates a dreadful additional weakness on b5.} 10. Bb5 axb4 11. Bxb4 Be7 12. Nb6 Rb8 13. Ne2 {Total and complete paralysis! The computer's top suggestion is 13...0-0, which tells you all you need to know about this position!}) 9. a3 {Solidifying White's queenside pawn chain, and taking the sting out of ...a5.} Nd5 10.

Of course, we could not care less about the c5-pawn: our only allegiance in this line is to rapid development.} Qxc5 $2 {This is automatic at most levels, although after this capture White's initiative becomes virtually decisive.} (6...
