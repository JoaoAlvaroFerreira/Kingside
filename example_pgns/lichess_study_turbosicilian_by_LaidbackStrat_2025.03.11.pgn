Conclusion The rare fifth moves against the Taimanov are not threatening, so this chapter was an easy start to building our repertoire.
A) 5.a3 and B) 5.g3!? can both be met in a similar style with 5...Bc5 6.Nb3 Bb6, avoiding any worries about transpositional tricks to other chapters. Then one common plan is ...Nge7 with ideas of ...f7-f5 or ...d7-d5. In the 5.g3 variation we also saw ideas of ...Nf6, ...d6 and ...e5, with an improved Kalashnikov.
C) 5.c4 looks a logical space-gainer, but Black can reply actively with 5...Nf6 6.Nc3 Bb4. There usually follows 7.Nxc6 bxc6 8.Bd3 when the move to remember is 8...e5!. Our b4-bishop then belongs on c5, getting a grip on the hole on d4.
D) 5.Be3 is a strange move to commit to so soon, and the main line transposes to the Four Knights variation. Objectively Black has no problems, but learning the antidote to Hector's old pet line would be wise, as it would be tough to work out over the board.
E) 5. Nxc6 is not a theoretical threat, but it leads to our first look at a vital structure, so the typical ideas are well worth a look } *

Following 6...e5 we started with an easy move in 7..Bg5? which allows Black an excellent exchange sacrifice.
Far more serious is 7..Be3, when I recommend the relatively unusual 7...Be7!. For a Taimanov player, the challenge of the lines that follow is that White often induces us to play a different Sicilian - sometimes a Kalashnikov, sometimes a Sveshnikov. The plus side is that we will not face the most critical lines of these openings. And the lines I give in this chapter should give you a solid understanding of how co play the resulting positions. } *

This version of the Maroczy offers white some space advantage in the early stages, but it comes at a price as he must waste time managing his misplaced knight. After 6... Nf6, we consider the sideline 7. N5c3 which does not offer White much, especially after Be7 g3, when h5 gives black great counterplay.
More common is 7. N1c3 a6, when White has two options. 8. Nd4 gives Black a lot of freedom, where we can liquidate the center immediately with d5 and equalize. We then began coverage of the most popular 8. Na3 line, the main line of which will be analysed in the following chapter. } *

What are the ideas behind the text move? The most obvious of them is to develop the bishop to b7 as fast as possible. An important point is that the immediate attempt to harass the black queen with 8. Nb5 is not at all dangerous. (There are some other instances, most notably variations D2 and E2, when the 8. Nb5 move should be taken more seriously, but Black always has enough resources to maintain the balance.).
It is worth mentioning that this chapter contains some variations in which Black follows up with a later ...a6 and ...b5, apparently losing a tempo. However, matters are not that simple, since we will only resort to ...b5 in certain situations, usually having already developed quickly with ...Bb7, ...Nf6 and ...Bc5. Note that the pawn on b6 supports a possible ...Bc5 even if the white bishop goes to e3, which would not have been the case if Black had gone for a straightforward ...a6/...b5 plan. When checking the database I noticed something interesting: when sorting by the rating of the White player, the top six games all ended in wins for White, some of them against similarly strong opponents. However, a closer inspection reveals that Black had the advantage in a number of those games and generally had no problems out of the opening } 8.

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nc6 5. Nc3 Qc7 6. g3 { The Fianchetto variation is a serious test of the Taimanov.
White's plan is quite simple: we will see in many variations with the white bishop on e2 that he usually plays f2-f4, g2-g4 and then maneuvers with Bf3-g2 in order to attack with his queen from h5.
So in the Fianchetto variation if Black plays in traditional Scheveningen style with ...Nf6, ...d6, ...Be7 then short castling is now dangerous. With the bishop sent directly to g2, many new ideas are possible for White; for example, he often takes on c6 and plays a quick e4-e5. This is particularly successful if Black has played a quick ...d6 and ...Nf6, but even with the pawn on d7 then Nxc6 and e4-e5 is an idea worth remembering.
Now, what are the drawbacks of White's setup? White leaves the c4-square unprotected and this is relevant in many cases, especially if White plays slowly, then Black's usual queenside counterplay is stronger. Also, with the white pawn already on g3, Black may launch his own h-pawn as a counterattacking weapon. In practice, this plan can be dangerous } 6... a6! { The safe choice } (6... Nf6 { Allows } 7.

{ The moral victor
After an early lapse by Tal on move 6, Fischer relentlessly presses home his advantage. He misses several opportunities to shorten Tal’s resistance, but the outcome is never really in doubt.

“Finally, he has not escaped me!” exulted Fischer.

“It is difficult to play against Einstein’s theory,” sighed Tal, who went on to capture first prize.

But it was Fischer, finishing a strong second, who had the consolation of scoring 3½ out of 4 against the Russian contingent, and of being the only player (in a field of twenty) to emerge undefeated. }

With 6.Be2 White hints that he will castle short and try to play a controlled classical game } 6... a6 { This is a vital tabiya in the Taimanov. } 7. Nxc6 { I wish to explain some basic considerations regarding White's capture on c6. Firstly, and most obviously, how should Black recapture? Before we start debating the advantages and disadvantages of each recapture, I would like to give a name to each of them that describes the kind of positions that arise later.
In this specific position, of course, you only need to have one recapture prepared to have a reliable repertoire, but you will face captures on c6 in many different positions, so it is wise to be familiar with the characteristics of all three recaptures.
First of all, the "Strategic Capture" is ...dxc6, as the play after ...dxc6 usually consists of typical knight manoeuvres. Black will probably have to play ...e5 and accept a symmetric position. There is nothing wrong with this capture, but usually it's the one I would choose last, as it is not so flexible. The second capture I will call the "Taimanov Capture". Black captures on c6 with the queen and then plays ...b5, ...Bb7, ...Nf6 (or ...Ne7), ...Be7 or ...Bc5) and the game continues in typical Taimanov style; Black combines both ...d5 and ...b4 breaks. It is also quite typical that Black will play ...Qc7 to defend against the e4-e5 push and to protect himself against Bf3, Re1 and Nd5 tricks.
So, as this book is a Taimanov repertoire, I would normally propose the "Taimanov Capture" and then continue the analysis. But I personally believe more in the "Dynamic Capture" which is ...bxc6. One can very easily understand the name of this capture; Black creates an imbalance in the pawn structure and wishes to build a strong centre with ...d7-d5. We will go into further details in the analysis } (7. f4 b5!?) (7. a3 { White's idea is to prevent Black from playing the standard move ...Bb4.

Bb4 9. e5 Nd5) (7. O-O) 7... bxc6 { The Dynamic Capture. In this chapter, we will study the basic concepts of this pawn structure. For a start, White's pieces are not ideally placed. The light-squared bishop would be better placed on d3, as it can do more to help the attack from that square; probably White will have to move the bishop again to d3. So we will not consider this position to be the tabiya. We will just explain here the basic plans for Black and White } (7... Qxc6 { The Taimanov Capture }) (7... dxc6 { The Strategic Capture }) 8.

Nf6 9. f4 d5 { White's light squared bishop would be better on d3 } 10. Bd3 (10. e5 Nd7 11. Qe1) 10... Be7 { White has two different plans. The first involves the e4-e5 push and in the second White tries to hold the tension in the centre. } 11. e5 { A) White plays e4-e5. White usually tries to combine attacking ideas on the kingside with a queenside breakthrough. White will try:
1) To keep the light-squared bishop in order to be able to attack on the kingside.
2) To exchange the dark-squared bishops. This exchange will let him have a better blockade on the c5-square if Black has not pushed his c-pawn, or attack the c5-pawn more effectively if Black has pushed the c-pawn. Moreover if Black has played the move ...g6 in order to defend his king, the f6-square will become even weaker.
3) White's basic plan is to play Na4, b2-b3, c2-c4. If Black has played ...c5 and ...d4 then there is a powerful manoeuvre with ie4 and Nb2-d3 coming. The dark-squared bishop might be developed to a3 in order to attack the c5-pawn. White's knight is ideally placed on b2 as it both blockades the passed d4-pawn and prevents the ...a5-a4 pawn breakthrough.
Black has to try to defend against White's above-mentioned plans.
1) Black will try to defend his king by playing ...g6 or .. .f5 at the appropriate moment. It is also quite possible to defend with the manoeuvre ...Rfd8 and ... Nf8 (or ...if8 and then ...g6, ...ig7).
2) Black should try to put some pressure on the b2-pawn. If White goes b2-b3, then try to attack on the queenside with the typical minority attack ...a5-a4 or even ...c5-c4. The light-squared bishop should be placed either on b7 in order to put long-term pressure on g2, or should be exchanged from a6. One key point is that if Black wants to go for ...f5 (or .. .f6 in some cases) the bishop should be placed on c8 to defend e6.
3) A final very important detail is that Black should try to exchange the knights. It may not seem obvious why Black should try to exchange the knights (in contrast, all of us would try to exchange the light-squared bishops immediately, as we understand that White's light-squared bishop is more useful than Black's). But to understand why Black should try to exchange knights requires some experience of playing the position. If you have not been tortured playing a position with the above-mentioned set-up b3, c4, ie4, Nd3 then you will not fully appreciate why exchanging the knights frees Black's hands. } (11. Qe2 { B) In the second plan White doesn't push the e-pawn and tries to keep the tension. In this situation there is no single standard plan for White or Black, as the position remains flexible and there are many possible plans for each side. We will give some typical examples.
White's plans are:
1) White usually plays standard waiting moves in order to improve his pieces. Moves such as Kh1 , Qe2, b3, Bb2, Rae1 . 2) After having playing most (or all) of the waiting moves above, White usually continues with e4-e5 and tries to enter a better version of Plan A, or plays exd5 and tries to continue the attack with f4-f5. Black's standard plans are:
1) Black could continue with standard moves such as ...Be7, ...0-0, ...Bb7, ...Rfe8 and ...c5.
2) Black should always be prepared to meet the e5-push with the plans described under Plan A. 3
3) Black could always think about playing ...dxe4, exchange the knights, and then play ...g6, ...Bf6 and slowly go for ...c5-c4 or ...a5-a4. }) *

- Move the attacked pawn with h3
- Block the diagonal with g3
- Defend indirectly with Kh1
- In some lines, f4 is possible, but here it would lose the queen.
Kh1 is the "correct" way to play. It avoids weakening the structure and prepares f4 to challenge the bishop. H3 weakens the G3 square and G3 weakens the light squares. White can then fianchetto the bishop to counter-act that, but it would've been better to do that from the start. It is also a target for h4. } 10...

Bb4 { Will be looked at in the next chapter in more depth. } 9. f3 { This chapter deals with a number of interesting sidelines after 7. 0-0 Nf6. Conveniently, we can meet the first three of them, Bg5, a3, and a4, with the same plan of Bd6 (before or after exchanging on d4), attacking the h2 pawn, followed by Be5.
8. Kh1 is more challenging, as white defends the h2 pawn in advance. So we change plans to Nxd4! Qxd4 Bc5, leading to a position rich in possibilities. Black has a full share of the chances though, and a number of attractive resources. } *

This chapter on 9. Nxc6 bxc6 proved to be more demanding than antiicpated. First we analysed the sideline of 10. f4 0-0 11. e5 Nd5 12. Nxd5 cxd5, when Black's position is fine but there are three main lines to check.
Then there's the more challenging option of 10. Qd4 c5 11. Qc4 0-0, when Na4 a5 is critical. Black has plenty of dynamic counter-chances but his b4-bishop is under constant threat of being trapped, so it is essential to know our lines and remain alert at the board. We analysed a few options but the main line continues 13. Qb3! d5! 14. exd5 exd5 15, c4! after which Bg4 is my improvement which I was able to test in a practical game. Black is in good shape theoretically, and there are plenty of attacking resources in the ensuing lines which could be used to catch an unsuspecting opponent. } *

Rad8 { Conclusion
6.Be3 a6 7.Bd3 is a sensible anti-Taimanov line, and one I have played regularly with both colours.
After 7...Nf6 we started with A) 8.Nb3 when play takes on a Scheveningen flavour. But we Taimanov players should not be concerned, as it's a rather harmless version with the knight passive on b3.
The usual move is B) 8.0-0 when I recommend 8...b5. Then B1) 9.a3 Bb7 tends to lead to another comfortable Scheveningen set-up, as White's options are limited on move 10 by Black's tactical ideas, which often involve ...Bc5. 10.Qe2 avoids the tricks, but will later prove to be an uninspired square for the queen.
Thus the toughest test is B2) 9.Nxc6 Qxc6 when White has three main options. 1O.a3 will be seen in the next chapter, so we started with B21) 10.f3!? and B22)10.Be2!?. Against B2 1 ) 1 0.f3!? I recommend the rare 10 ...b4! as an effective antidote.
B22) 10.ie2!? has some poisonous ideas involving e4-e5 and if3, so I recommend 10 ...id6!? covering the key square. Following 1 1 .�d4! ib7 we have a split, depending on which rook White places on d1. Black's choice of bishop retreat should be different in each variation. Go to b8 against the former and go to e7 against the latter. The point is that with a rook still on A1, the ...Bb8-a7 idea runs into a nasty a2-a4. I analysed the final variation in painstaking depth, as forcing play can last all the way to a simple endgame. This is not what a Sicilian fighter dreams of, but sometimes we need to be ready with deep theory. } { [%csl Gd4][%cal Gd8d4] } *

It is especially popular against the Dragon since there it is the most promising line for White. Sometimes it is combined with the move Bc4 in order to secure better control of the d5-square.
In general it is considered to be one of White's most aggressive approaches. White usually opts for opposite-sides castling and often tries to attack with g2-g4, h4-h5, then g5 , gaining the initiative on the kingside. On the other hand, Black usually tries to exploit the queenside with . . .b5-b4 and . . .a5-a4, or tries to increase the pressure along the c-file against the c3-knight and the c2-pawn.
