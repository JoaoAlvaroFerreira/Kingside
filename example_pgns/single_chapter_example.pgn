It is especially popular against the Dragon since there it is the most promising line for White. Sometimes it is combined with the move Bc4 in order to secure better control of the d5-square.
In general it is considered to be one of White's most aggressive approaches. White usually opts for opposite-sides castling and often tries to attack with g2-g4, h4-h5, then g5 , gaining the initiative on the kingside. On the other hand, Black usually tries to exploit the queenside with . . .b5-b4 and . . .a5-a4, or tries to increase the pressure along the c-file against the c3-knight and the c2-pawn. Keep in mind that Black usually has more targets for his attack, but White is usually faster with his pawn-storm attack and has more pieces defending his king than Black } 7... Nf6 { After Black's obvious developer, we have a split: } 8. O-O-O (8. f3 { Interesting and tricky line } 8... Ne5 { Seeking to transpose to mainline } (8...

O-O-O d6 { Should lead to a stable position, let's just not get too eager with B5 }) 9... h6 { In this move order, White's g-pawn is arriving earlier than usual, so Black is well-advised to slow it down with . . .h7-h6. This will not be our usual response to a g4-advance } 10.

Black wishes to expand on the queenside and break with d5 if possible. } 13. Be2 { The position after the text move has been employed with White by strong GMs such as Cheparinov, Robson and Kovchan.

A rare but super-critical continuation! In fact, after trying my best, I couldn't find a fully dynamic solution for Black. I think we should place our hopes in an endgame a pawn down, but with clear counterplay. Such endgames might seem dry, but I have witnessed many cases (especially in dub-level play) where players get frustrated and lose such positions with White by simply trying to "do something" } 10... b5! 11. a3! { The critical move. } (11.

Bxe5 dxe5 17. Nc6 { Compared to the previous more direct sideline, White has managed to get rid of the doubled C pawns and will collect the c4 pawn later. } 17... Bd7 18. Nxe5 c3! { The key move. It is important for Black to hold the c-pawn as long as possible in order to gain activity with his other pieces. Until this point White played active chess and managed to create a target, which will later lead him to win a pawn. Now it is Black's turn to gain the initiative and it is White's turn to defend, if he wants to maintain any kind of winning chances. } 19. Rd3 (19. h4 Ke7 20. Rd3 Rhc8 { Is easier for black. }) 19...

Nb3 Ke7!! { When I first found this move, I thought it would be a novelty, but strangely enough it was played back in 2003, as well as in a few more recent email games.

We need to examine a variety of moves. } 11. Qf2 { Although this move is not very popular, it was employed by the top GM Dominguez. I figured out that Dominguez and Quesada really like the idea of manoeuvring White's queen to f2 and getting rid of the pin. White tries to control the dark squares but on the other hand leaves the c3-knight unprotected. So it becomes clear that White cannot afford to employ a slow plan with g4-g5, h4-h5 since Black will capture on c3 at some point } (11. Qd4) (11. Bd4) (11. Kb1 Be7! 12. Qf2 Bb7 13. Bb6 (13.
